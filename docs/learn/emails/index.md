## Introduction

*Emails* in Rossum represent a single email sent to or from the platform ([docs](https://elis.rossum.ai/api/docs/#email)). They can be a part of an *email thread* ([docs](https://elis.rossum.ai/api/docs/#email-thread)) which is a grouping of related emails similar to what you are used to in email clients (e.g., Gmail). These email objects also have a link to related annotations and documents = documents that were sent as email attachments and processed into annotations in Rossum.
