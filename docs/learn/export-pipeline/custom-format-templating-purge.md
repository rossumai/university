# Custom format templating purge

Extensions like [Custom format templating](./custom-format-templating.md) and [REST API export](./rest-api-export.md) (and possibly others) store their API responses and artefacts in the annotation metadata. When re-exporting, we need to remove these old documents and responses to ensure a clean start. The purge extension helps us achieve this.

Additionally, this extension takes care of a cleanup when purging the original documents from Rossum (by default, all generated artifacts would stay in the system orphaned). Deleting such orphaned artifacts might be very important for **compliance reasons**.
