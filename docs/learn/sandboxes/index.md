<PaidFeature />

Rossum Sandboxes allow for isolated development of the solution and easy deployments of the tested solution to production.

Using Sandboxes currently requires installation of an external tooling available at: https://github.com/rossumai/deployment-manager

## Installation

First, download the install script for our Sandboxing tool `deployment-manager` from its Rossum GitHub repository:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossumai/deployment-manager/main/install.sh)"
```

The script will automatically run and install the Sandboxing tool in the `~/.local/bin` folder making it available globally under the command `prd`.

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
prd update
```

You can find more information here: https://github.com/rossumai/deployment-manager

## Available CLI commands

`prd` is a CLI tool and offers the following main commands:

- `prd init`: Initialize a new project (creates mainly `credentials.json` and `prd_config.yaml` files). When called with a project name, it also initialized an empty Git repository.
- `prd pull`: Pulls all objects from both `source` and `target` organizations (as per your configuration). It is possible to explicitly specify `source`/`target` to pull only that one environment, for example: `prd pull source`
- `prd push`: Pushes the latest changes to the `source` organization. This is effectively a counterpart of the `pull` command.
- `prd release`: Pushes the latest changes to the `target` organization. Visit [Deployment patterns](./deployment-patterns.md#two-environments-for-sandbox-and-production) to learn more about this use-case.
- `prd purge`: Removes all objects in the target organization.
- `prd purge unused_schemas`: Removes old unused schemas.

Complete list of commands and their parameters can be found when running `prd --help`.

## Available configuration options

The only necessary configuration is in the `credentials.json` and in the `prd_config.yaml` files right after running `prd init`.

First, we will setup credentials in the `credentials.json` file, where we can work with username and password combination ([Example 1](#example-1)), or alternatively we can use `token` ([Example 2](#example-2)).

#### Example 1

Authentication using username and password.

```json title="credentials.json"
{
  // Source organization (typically the only one needed).
  "source": {
    // Username under which `prd` will be calling the API.
    "username": "...",

    // Password for the user under which `prd` will be calling the API.
    "password": "..."
  },

  // Target organization in case it is necessary to release into a different organization
  // from source. The configuration is identical with `source` parameter.
  "target": {
    "username": "...",

    "password": "..."
  }
}
```

#### Example 2

Alternatively, you can use API token instead of username and password (if you have it):

```json title="credentials.json"
{
  "source": {
    // highlight-start
    "token": "..." // use API token instead of username/password
    // highlight-end
  },
  "target": {
    "token": "..."
  }
}
```

Finally, to set up the organization's URL, we need to edit the `prd_config.yaml` file, where we specify the source API URL. If the target API URL is different from the source, we can also specify `target_api_base`.

If the URLs are identical, you can add the `use_same_org_as_target` parameter with the value `true`. In this case, you can remove `target_api_base`.

```yaml title="prd_config.yaml"
# You can specify source and target API URL:
source_api_base: 'https://api.elis.rossum.ai/v1'
target_api_base: 'https://api.elis.rossum.ai/v1'

# Or add this to your YAML file in case the source and target are identical (and omit the target_api_base):
use_same_org_as_target: true
```

## Configuring `mapping.yaml` file

Note that this file is automatically generated by the `prd pull` command. It is typically not necessary to configure it manually unless some more advanced use-case is needed.

```yaml
