# Best practices for content

### Index page

There should almost always be an index page in `index.md` with the following sections for fast and easy onboarding:

1. A section shortly explaining what does the extensions do.
2. **Installation** section. If it's a webhook, it should also contain `<WebhookEndpoint />` component.
3. **Basic usage** section describing a minimal extension setup (quick start).
4. **Available configuration options** so that users know what options are available

### Configuration examples page

TODO

## Common rules for all content

### H1

- One per page
- Sentence case (Getting started with Rossum)
- Capital letters for proper nouns, product/feature names (Master Data Hub extension, How to use Aurora for Complex Tables)
- Typeface = Satoshi Variable

### H2

- Multiple per page
- Sentence case
- Typeface = Satoshi Variable

### H3

- Multiple per page
- Sentence case
- Typeface = Satoshi Variable

### Content

- Typeface = Satoshi Variable
- US spelling (Organization, color, behavior)
- Initialisms/Acronyms - first usage written in full (Intelligent document processing (IDP), Robotic process automation (RPA))
- Left aligned text
- Avoid ALL CAPS as it’s harder to read
- Avoid underlines unless it’s a link
- Tone of voice = human, trustworthy, accessible, precise, and playful (when appropriate)

### Images

- New branding
- Alt image text for each, describing what's being shown
